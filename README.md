# JsonTreeLikeViewer

This is a tree-like view of an arbitrary multilevel JSON object currently being developed with Angular 7

## How it works.

Given an arbitrary multilevel JSON object.

It displays:
   
   - A `string` in text input

    - A `number` in number input

    - A `boolean` as a checkbox with value checked if boolean is true and unchecked if boolean is false

    - An `object` as a nested object that should be collapsible and extendible 

## How to start development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to build for production

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
